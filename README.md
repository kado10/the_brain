# The Brain Website

This was my first main attempt at coding a website from scratch, years ago at the start of my coding journey. It is missing the information the ideas are all there!
There is an SVG which has been manipulated using CSS to highlight the different areas of the brain. HTML gives the overall structure for the website. The premise is that the website
could act as a learning tool for any budding neuroscientists, doctors or just those who were interested in the subject to help learn
about the area of the brain and the associated disorders and symptomatology.
